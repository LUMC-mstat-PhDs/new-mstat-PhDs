- IBS: International Biometrics Society - https://www.biometricsociety.org/
-- More methodological international society, more focused on new developments from mathematical statistics than application.


Conferences: 
- ISCB - International Society for Clinical Biostatistics; most visited conference; presentations usually include some new methodology applied to either real or simulated data. Generally in Europe
- SAfJR - Survival Analysis for Junior Researchers; What the title says. Wide range of topics from very mathematical to quite applied. In Europe.
- SMDM - Society for Medical Decision Making; If your project involved statistics that apply in particular to decision making, this can be interesting. Alternates yearly between EU and US - US is nice but pricier, easier to attend in EU.
- IBC - International Biometrics Conference; More fundamental than ISCB. Conference every 2 years can be anywhere in the world.
- CNC - Channel Network Conference - Organised by in part by BMS (Biometrics section of VVSOR) with many people from Leiden. 
- VVSOR Annual Meeting - One day conference in the Netherlands. Broad topics, nice if you can go.
